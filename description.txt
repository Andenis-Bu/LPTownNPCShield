[c/ff9eb4:LP's Town NPC Shield]
LP's Town NPC Shield is a mod for Terraria designed to significantly enhance the protection of town NPCs. This mod ensures that friendly NPCs only take minimal damage (1 point) from bosses and other hostile mobs, making them virtually invincible in combat situations.

[c/ff9eb4:How It Works:]
• [c/f5ffc7:Damage Reduction from Mobs:] The mod detects when a town NPC is attacked by a boss or hostile mob and reduces the damage to 1 point, ensuring that NPCs take minimal damage from these enemies.
• [c/f5ffc7:Environmental Vulnerability:] Damage from environmental sources such as traps, lava, and other natural hazards is not affected by the mod, allowing NPCs to still be harmed by these causes.

[c/ff9eb4:Compatibility]
LP's Town NPC Shield is compatible with most other mods. If you encounter any issues, please report them on the GitHub issues page.
